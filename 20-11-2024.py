"""GIT:

Git is a free, open-source version control system (VCS) that's used to track code changes and maintain a history of modifications.
It's the most widely used VCS in the world and is considered the modern standard for software development. 
Here are some features of Git.

• Distributed: Each developer has a local clone of the project's history, so they can work offline or remotely. 
• Branching: Developers can create a copy of their source code, called a branch, to work on in parallel to the main version. 
• Merging: Developers can merge their branch back into the main version.
• Committing: Developers can commit their work locally, and then sync their copy of the repository with the copy on the server. 
• Reverting: Developers can revert to older versions of the code and undo changes.
• Pull requests: A popular tool that allows teams to collaborate on Git branches and review each other's code.

GITHUB:

GitHub is a web-based platform that allows developers

Store, share, and collaborate on code
Users can create, store, and manage their code in a "repository". 
They can also share their work, track changes, and collaborate on projects with others.
 
Use version control
GitHub uses Git, an open source version control system, to track changes to code and reduce duplicating work.
 
Use management tools
GitHub provides tools for managing changes from multiple developers, including pull requests, which show differences in colors.
 
Choose repository visibility
Users can choose to make their repositories public or private. 
Public repositories are accessible to everyone on the internet, while private repositories are only accessible to the owner and people they share access with. 
GitHub is popular because it's: Easy to use, Has robust documentation and support, and Encourages collaboration. 
GitHub was founded in 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett, and Scott Chacon. In 2018, Microsoft acquired GitHub for $7.5 billion. 

VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM:

A version control system (VCS) tracks changes to files and allows developers to collaborate and return to earlier versions.
VCSs are also known as source control or revision control.

Here are some types of VCSs: 
Centralized version control systems (CVCS)
A single server stores all file versions, backup files, and the number of contributors.
Developers borrow files to edit and return them with updates.
 
Distributed version control systems (DVCS)
Each developer has the entire project history locally on their computer.
This allows for offline work and branching and merging strategies.
 
Local version control system
A local database on a computer stores file changes as patches. 
To recreate a file, all patches are added up. 

Mercurial
A VCS designed to handle large distributed projects.
 
Git
A VCS that tracks changes to a codebase. 

Subversion
A VCS that tracks changes to files, folders, and directories. 
This helps with data recovery and provides a history of changes.
 
Concurrent versions system (CVS)
Multiple developers can work on a project concurrently. 
Each developer has a copy of the source tree from a central repository.
 
Unity Version Control
A VCS used to track changes to the source code of mobile games. 
It helps maintain coordination among the team.
 
AWS CodeCommit
A managed VCS that hosts private Git repositories in secure AWS environments"""
